# How to build a website
you have a business and you want to make a website for it?, first you have to define the structure of your website using html.
## what is HTML?
**HTML:** it is a Hypertext Markup Language that helps you to describe the structure of pages  by using elements each element has an opening tag and a closing tag ,these tags tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
### Note:
 you can put *Attributes* inside the opening tag to provide additional information about the contents of an element. the attributes made up of two parts: a name and a value,separated by an equals sign.

## HTML Basic elements to make a webpage:
1. **Head**

This contains information about the page  You will usually find a title
element inside the head element. the title element  defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. and you will find meta element which used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

2.  **Body**
contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

## Why we write DOCTYPE inside the HTML structure 
Because there have been several versions of HTML, we write DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML
the page is using.

## HTML Attributes:

1. ###  Comments inside HTML
Writing comments inside the html help you to arrange and understand your page, the cooments will not be visible in the user's browser.

2. ### id attribute
id attribute is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

3. ### class attribute 
it's used to identify several elemnts as being different from the other elemnets on the page.

## Types of elements in HTML
1. Block elements

elements that appear to start on a new line in the browser window like: headings,paragraph,unordered list, list

2. inline elemnts

elements that appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements like:a element,b element,em elemnt and img element.

## How to group text and elements in a block 
1. ### div 
the div  element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.For example, you might create a div element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a div element to contain comments from visitors.
2. ### span 
The span element acts like an inline equivalent of the div element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline
elements

**The most common reason why people use span elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS**
